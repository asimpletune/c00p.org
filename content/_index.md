# What is this site?

My name is [Spence](https://spenc.es/), and I want to organize a group of people who are interested in buying a building together, so we can each have our own apartment.

# Are you interested?

I am really hoping that this is something that other people will find exciting.
If this sounds like something you'd be interested in let me know by adding your name to this waitlist. If I don't hear from anyone then I'll know not to waste my time.

I promise that I won't share your information with anyone else. You can also just [send me an email](mailto:spence@c00p.org) if you feel more comfortable with that, or you just want to chat.

<!-- Note: waitlist i18n has to be set in front matter, i.e. the "+++" above, for this to be translated -->
